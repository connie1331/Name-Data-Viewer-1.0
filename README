# Description:

    The program Name Data Viewer uses object(s) created from the Name class. This program fetches name data from a
database and prints out the results to the screen.

    The Name class is stored in a module named Name (Name.py). This code use object(s) from the Database class to define
a static method. This code defines a constructor that stores values for name, year, gender, and count for the object.
This code also has setters and getters for the 4 properties above. Then,it defines a static method called readName()
which call Database.readName() and return its result.

    The Database class is stored in a module named Database (Database.py). This file is just a "stubbed" in this
program since we will learn how to fetch data from a database in the future. This code defines a class method called
readNames(). When readName() is called, it returns a list containing at least 4 dictionary objects with name data.

    The main (main.py) contains the main code of the program. This code imports the Name class from the Name module.
The code includes a main function which calls Name.readNames(). The readNames() method should return a
list of Name objects. The function should loop through each Name object in the list of Name objects and write a line to
the console that includes all of the data for that Name object. Your output should look something like this (fancier is
fine, but not required, and you are free to use different data):
